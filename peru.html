    <p>We went to Peru in October 2015 with four other friends. We first acclimated to the altitude by staying in Cusco for two nights. While in Cusco, we tried the Pisco Sours which are similar to margaritas. We took a day trip to see Moray (an Inca site with round terraces for farming) and the Salinas de Maras (salt mines).</p>

        <p>After two days in Cusco, we woke up extremely early to start our hike to Machu Picchu. We hiked for three and a half days and it was the most physically difficult thing I have ever done. The altitude was brutal for breathing and the second day reaches an altitude of 14000 feet above sea level. Every night, we would camp which was uncomfortable and dirty. However, the feeling of accomplishment and pride when reaching Machu Picchu cannot be explained.</p>

    <p>After our hike, we flew to Lima and took a day trip to Huacachina. We first started with a boat ride and then went to the Oasis where we rode sand buggies and sandboarded on the sand dunes. It was extremely fun but I got too scared to sandboard off of tall dunes. We also visited the vineyard to see how Pisco is made and try different variations. </p>
